## 🌐Globo-Project

This project is a replica of a news page inspired by the Globo portal, developed as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to faithfully reproduce the layout provided in Figma, ensuring accuracy in colors, dimensions, and typography.

## 🚀*Technologies Used*

- *HTML5* – For semantic and structured markup  
- *CSS3* – For styling and layout  
- *Google Fonts (Encode Sans)* – Ensuring the correct typography  
- *CodeSandbox* (Optional) – For development and testing  

## 🎯*Requirements Met*

- ✅ *Semantic HTML5 Structure* – Clean and accessible markup  
- ✅ *CSS3 Styling* – Matches the original Figma design  
- ✅ *Google Fonts Usage* – Ensuring typography consistency  
- ✅ *Well-Organized Code* – Follows best practices for maintainability  
- ✅ *Structured Assets* – Images and icons are organized in proper directories  
- ✅ *Clickable News Links* – All headlines and images must be links (they can be "fake" links, e.g., https://globo.com)

## 📝*Code Language*

The source code is written in *Portuguese, but the documentation is in **English* for accessibility.

## ✨ *How to View the Project*

This is a static front-end project (HTML/CSS). To view it in your browser, you have a few options:

1.  **Download and Open Locally:**
    * **Clone the repository:**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ClaraDev01/Projeto-Globo.git
        ```
    * **Navigate to the project directory:**
        ```bash
        cd Projeto-Globo
        ```
    * **Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.** You can do this by dragging the `index.html` file into the browser window or by double-clicking it.

2.  **Use a Local Server Extension (Recommended for Development):**
    * If you use **VS Code**, you can install the **Live Server** extension.
    * With the extension installed, open the project in VS Code, right-click on the `index.html` file, and select "Open with Live Server". This will start a local server and open the project in your browser with live reloading.

3.  **Host on Free Services (Like GitHub Pages):**
    * You can host this project for free using **GitHub Pages**. Simply configure GitHub Pages to serve content from the `main` (or `master`) branch of your repository. GitHub will then generate a public link for your site (e.g., `https://YourUsername.github.io/Projeto-Globo/`).
