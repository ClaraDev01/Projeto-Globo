## Globo-Project

This project is a replica of a news page inspired by the Globo portal, developed as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to faithfully reproduce the layout provided in Figma, ensuring accuracy in colors, dimensions, and typography.

## 🚀*Technologies Used*

- *HTML5* – For semantic and structured markup  
- *CSS3* – For styling and layout  
- *Google Fonts (Encode Sans)* – Ensuring the correct typography  
- *CodeSandbox* (Optional) – For development and testing  

## 🎯*Requirements Met*

- ✅ *Semantic HTML5 Structure* – Clean and accessible markup  
- ✅ *CSS3 Styling* – Matches the original Figma design  
- ✅ *Google Fonts Usage* – Ensuring typography consistency  
- ✅ *Well-Organized Code* – Follows best practices for maintainability  
- ✅ *Structured Assets* – Images and icons are organized in proper directories  
- ✅ *Clickable News Links* – All headlines and images must be links (they can be "fake" links, e.g., https://globo.com)
